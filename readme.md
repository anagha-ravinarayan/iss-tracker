# ISS Tracker

A Python app to track the position of the International Space Station, and to notify you if it is visible in the sky at your location.

### Steps to take before running this program
1. Change MY_EMAIL, MY_PASSWORD, MY_EMAIL_SMTP_SERVER, MY_LAT and MY_LONG to your own details in the file main.py.
2. Go to your email provider and make it allow less secure apps.
3. Keep this app running for a few hours at night, since the ISS can take time to pass your city.
